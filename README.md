# Loan Eligibility Prediction
## Overview
- This project predicts loan eligibility based on a machine learning model trained on applicant data. It aims to assist financial institutions in automating the loan approval process by predicting whether a loan should be approved for a particular applicant.

## Project Structure
### Data Loading and Preprocessing:
- The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.

### Model Selection and Training:
- A **Naive Bayes classifier** (or another suitable model) is trained on the preprocessed data to predict loan eligibility.

### Prediction and Evaluation:
- The trained model is used to make predictions on the test dataset.
- The predictions are evaluated using appropriate metrics to determine model performance.

### Visualization:
- Visual tools such as graphs and charts are used to provide insights into the data and model predictions.

### Requirements
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Results
- The model predicts loan eligibility with [include model accuracy or other metrics here]. These predictions can help in making informed decisions about loan approvals.

## Conclusion
- This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict loan eligibility. By automating the loan approval process, financial institutions can save time and reduce errors associated with manual processing.
